            <h1>History</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Niagara Falls is the collective name for three waterfalls that straddle the international border between the Canadian province of Ontario and the American state of New York. They form the southern end of the Niagara Gorge. From largest to smallest, the three waterfalls are the Horseshoe Falls, the American Falls and the Bridal Veil Falls. The Horseshoe Falls lies on the border of the United States and Canada with the American Falls entirely on the United States' side, separated by Goat Island. The smaller Bridal Veil Falls are also on the United States' side, separated from the American Falls by Luna Island.
                    Located on the Niagara River, which drains Lake Erie into Lake Ontario, the combined falls form the highest flow rate of any waterfall in North America that has a vertical drop of more than 50 metres (160 ft). During peak daytime tourist hours, more than 168,000 m3 (six million cubic feet) of water goes over the crest of the falls every minute. Horseshoe Falls is the most powerful waterfall in North America, as measured by flow rate.
                    The falls are 27 kilometres (17 mi) north-northwest of Buffalo, New York, and 121 kilometres (75 mi) south-southeast of Toronto, between the twin cities of Niagara Falls, Ontario, and Niagara Falls, New York. Niagara Falls was formed when glaciers receded at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation (the last ice age), and water from the newly formed Great Lakes carved a path through the Niagara Escarpment en route to the Atlantic Ocean.
                    Niagara Falls is famed both for its beauty and as a valuable source of hydroelectric power. Balancing recreational, commercial, and industrial uses has been a challenge for the stewards of the falls since the 19th century.

            <h1>Some Interesting Facts About Niagara Falls</h1>
            <hr>
            <ul class="content">
                <li>Niagara Falls is the collective name for three water Falls that overlap the international borders of Canada and New York.</li>
                <li>You are almost always guaranteed to see a rainbow if you’re on the Canadian side of the Falls. To capture this beautiful phenomenon be sure grab your camera and visit from about noon until the sun sets.</li>
                <li>Fish actually travel over the Falls. Don’t believe it? Visit the Cave of the Winds for $10. This place will prove the fact and you might even meet someone who has actually been struck by a fish on his journey down the Falls.</li>
                <li>Approximately 90% of the fish that travel down Niagara Falls survive. It is believed that the white foam from the rushing waters acts like a cushion for the fish traveling down the waters.</li>
                <li>Back in the 1800’s Niagara Falls was nearly frozen solid. The water was so frozen that only a small trickle of water traveled down the Falls.</li>
                <li>About 28,000,000 (that’s 28 million!) liters of water travel down Niagara Falls every second.</li>
                <li>The first person to ever go over the Falls was a courageous 63-year-old teacher. She traveled down the Falls in a barrel.</li>
                <li>About 20% of the drinking water in the United States goes through and over Niagara Falls. Yup, you have most likely drank water that came from the Falls.</li>
                <li>Niagara Falls is not the highest waterfall in the world. There are actually about 500 waterfalls that are taller than Niagara. It’s actually the combination of height and large volume of water that makes Niagara Falls a great tourist destination.</li>
                <li>Although Niagara Falls isn’t the tallest waterfall in the world, it may be the fastest moving waterfall on the planet.</li>
                <li>Niagara Falls is the result of glaciers.</li>
                <li>Parts of the movie Pirates of the Caribbean was filmed at Niagara Falls. Superman and Niagara starring Marilyn Monroe were also filmed here.</li>
